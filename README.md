# A tool for tracking workout progress

I use Notion as a database to store all my workout data, including the number of sets and repetitions of every exercise, the intensity of the workout, and other important metrics. I created this custom dashboard to visualize this data in an easy-to-understand graphical way, allowing me to easily track my progress over time and make changes to my routine accordingly. 

## Main idea

This diagram shows how the application works.

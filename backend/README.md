# Workout tracker dashboard

## Context 
I use Notion as a database to store all my workout sessions data. Each workout session contains the number of sets and repetitions of every exercise, as well as other metrics. The goal of this dashboard is to present this data in a comprehensible graphical manner, facilitating the tracking of progress over time and enabling adjustments to my routine as needed.
